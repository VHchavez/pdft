PDFT is designed for calculating the ground-state properties of a full molecular system via self-consistent calculations on isolated fragments. 

### Requirements:
PDFT works as an interface to Psi4. In order to use PDFT, Psi4 must be installed: https://github.com/psi4/psi4

It is also a good idea to become familiarized with their code. Great examples are found here: https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy
